# C 2048
Pure c terminal implementation of 2048 game
targetting to be adaptive to various window sizes

(ok i kinda lied, it uses system() func with 'clear' on linux and 'cls' on windows)

# Status
Really raw, has a lot of questionable solutions but,
at least in some circumstances, it works

I forgot literally everything i wanted to do with it

Maybe i will continue working on this.
Maybe i will even finish it someday, nobody knows ._.

Anyway, good luck to you, whoever you are, whatever you are looking for
